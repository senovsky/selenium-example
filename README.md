# Example project of Selenium WebDriver v4 with JavaScript

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js v18+ installed (NVM recommended)
2. Run command `npm install`

## Execution

Run command `npm test`. This will launch a Selenium-controlled instance of the Chrome browser and run a test file `first-script.spec.js`.

## Results

Result of the test will be printed in the terminal.

## Further improvements

- Adding multi-browser support without duplicating the test cases
- Base URL is hard-coded, should be moved into configuration
- Other ways of reporting the test results can be implemented (HTML report, CI/CD integration, Slack message, ...)
